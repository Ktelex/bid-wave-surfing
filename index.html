<h2>what is big wave surfing?</h2>
Big wave surfing is a discipline within surfing in which experienced surfers
 paddle into, or are towed into, waves which are at least 20 feet (6.2 m) high, on surf
 boards known as "guns" or towboards.[1] Sizes of the board needed to successfully surf
 these waves vary by the size of the wave as well as the technique the surfer uses to reach
 the wave. A larger, longer board allows a rider to paddle fast enough to catch the wave and
 has the advantage of being more stable, but it also limits maneuverability and surfing speed.[2][3]

<div id="specialstyle">In a big wave wipeout, a breaking wave can push 
surfers down 20 to 50 feet (6.2 m to 15.5 m) below 
the surface</div>
Once they stop spinning around, they
have to quickly regain their equilibrium and figure 
out which way is up. Surfers may have less than 20 
seconds to get to the surface before the next wave 
hits them. Additionally, the water pressure at a 
depth of 20 to 50 feet can be strong enough to rupture 
one's eardrums. Strong currents and water action at those 
depths can also slam a surfer into a reef or the ocean floor,
which can result in severe injuries or even death.<be>

<hr>
<P><span style="color:red;" >One of the greatest dangers is the risk of being held underwater by two
</span>
or more consecutive waves. Surviving a 
triple hold-down is extremely difficult, 
and surfers must be prepared to cope with these situations.
